# Using Classes to Structure Related Data

A *class* is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with classes, demonstrate how to use classes, and discuss how to define methods and associated functions to specify behavior associated with a class’ data. Classes and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of CCore’s compile time type checking.
